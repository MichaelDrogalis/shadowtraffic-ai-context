# ShadowTraffic AI context

This repo contains artifacts that improve agentic coding tools ability to work with ShadowTraffic. It includes:

- [**AI-friendly documentation**](/markdown-docs/docs.md): LLMs love Markdown, so I compiled ShadowTraffic's documentation into a single, neatly formatted Markdown file. It's easy to drop into your LLM as a knowledge source, and it's automatically updated whenever ShadowTraffic's official docs change.

âœ¨ More to come. :)

Happy to accept pull requests!
