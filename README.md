# ShadowTraffic AI context

This repo contains artifacts that improve agentic coding tools ability to work with ShadowTraffic. It includes:

- [**AI-friendly documentation**](/markdown-docs/docs.md): LLMs love Markdown, so I compiled ShadowTraffic's documentation and examples into a single, neatly formatted Markdown file. It's easy to drop into your LLM as a knowledge source, and it's automatically updated whenever ShadowTraffic's official docs change.
  - [Claude: Add files to projects](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9517075-what-are-projects)
  - [Cursor: Add custom docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs)
  - [GitHub Copilot: Add a knowledge base](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/context/managing-copilot-knowledge-bases)

âœ¨ More to come. :)

Happy to accept pull requests!
